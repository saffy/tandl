# Fishing

Fishing in game is easy, but the in-game instruction is poor. Here is a quick summary to help you keep that fish on the line!

1. Make sure you have a rod equipped. Check your Character Info (P) and Right Click the rod to equip it.
1. Next, we need bait. You can use gatherables, like worms, or fishing bait purchased from the Sundries Vendor, 50 per day. Equip the bait.
1. Equip your rod holding `CTRL`+ `F`, this cannot be done in combat.
1. Rotate the camera to look at the water, you should see a transparent indictor for where your rod will be cast. Press `F` to cast your rod and prepare your fingers to hit `Q`.
1. Wait until the fish is hooked, the UI will update when you have the fish and the reel timer begins. It is *not* necessary to hit Q to fish, however hitting it reduces the catch timer and makes it quicker and easier to reel in the fish.
1. To reel, you will need to constantly press and release `A` or `D`. If the fish moves Left/Right continuously press and release the opposite directional button. 

:::note
You want to keep pressing and releasing to regenerate your stamina, and hold the key when you need to reel the float away from the edge.

:::note

If the float hits the edge of your range, it will flash red. If it stays this way for too long you will lose the fish.
